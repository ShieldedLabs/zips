# Terminology

The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "MAY", "RECOMMENDED", "OPTIONAL",
and "REQUIRED" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
[1]

The term "network upgrade" in this document is to be interpreted as described in
ZIP 200. [2]

"Block Subsidy” - the algorithmic issuance of ZEC on block creation. Part of the
consensus rules. Split between the miner and the Dev Fund. Also known as Block
Reward.

"Issuance" - The method by which ZEC becomes available for circulation on the
network.

"We" - the ZIP Owners and Authors, listed in the above front matter.

"`MAX_MONEY`" is the total ZEC supply cap, defined as 21,000,000 ZEC. This is
slightly larger than the supply cap for the current issuance mechanism, but is
the value used in existing critical consensus checks.

# Abstract

We propose the introduction of a mechanism to voluntarily burn funds, removing
those funds entirely from circulation on the network. This mechanism, in
combination with ZIPs 234 and 235, comprises a long-term strategy for the
sustainability of the network. We will refer to the combined effects of these
three ZIPs as the “Network Sustainability Mechanism”.

# Motivation

This mechanism seeks to address concerns about the sustainability of the network
design shared by Bitcoin-like systems:

1. **Long Term Consensus Sustainability:** By enabling the burning of funds, the
   network gains the ability to create "headroom" between the chain value and
   `MAX_MONEY`. This lays necessary groundwork for extending the miner reward
   system, which currently has a clear final end date.
2. **Benefits to ZEC Holders:** Burning funds reduces the supply of ZEC,
   benefiting network users in proportion to their holdings without requiring
   them to opt into any scheme, introducing extra risk, active oversight, or
   accounting complexity.

# Specification

The modifications required are:

1. The addition of a transaction field representing an amount to burn for a
   given transaction.
2. The inclusion of the burn amount in the calculated total output value for a
   given transaction.
3. Consensus rules to ensure the burned amount is no longer available for
   circulation on the network.

## Burning

We add a new field to the common transaction fields [3]:

    burnAmount : uint64 [zatoshi]

This field specifies how much of the input value for the transaction should be
burned.

**Note:** Older transaction versions can continue to be supported after a
network upgrade, but burning is not possible for these transactions. For
example, NU5 supports both v4 and v5 transaction formats, for both coinbase and
non-coinbase transactions.

## Consensus Rule Changes

The burned value must now be considered when calculating the total output value
of a transaction. It should be treated similarly to a transparent output,
except that there is no way for this value to be used as an input in a future
transaction.

## Transaction Format Requirements

* ZIP 230 [3] must be updated to include the new `burnAmount` field.
* ZIP 244 [4] must be updated as well to include the new `burnAmount` field.

# Rationale

All technical decisions in this ZIP are balanced between the necessary
robustness of the NSM mechanics, and simplicity of implementation.

## New transaction field for burn amount

An explicit value distinguishes the burned ZEC from the implicit transaction
fee. Explicitness also ensures any arithmetic flaws in any implementations are
more likely to be observed and caught immediately.

# Deployment

This ZIP is proposed to activate with Network Upgrade 7.
